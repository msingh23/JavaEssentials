Design Pattern
- Think of designing classes in a way to be able to resist maximum maintaince during CHANGE.
- Design should be open to extension but closed for modification.
	- Thus coding to an interface instead of a concrete implementation(new class) shield from potential changes when new subclasses are added.
	
	
STEPS FOR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TECHNICAL
	- clarify the questions
	- Example which is not small, specific or special case.
	- Brute force.
	- Optimize
		- look for any unused information
		- start with fresh example if stuck
		- solve it incorrectly and then try fix the errors.
